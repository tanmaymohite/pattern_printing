# 🔢 C Pattern Printing Collection

A comprehensive collection of **C programs** that generate over **90 unique mathematical and visual patterns** using nested loops.  
This project is perfect for beginners and intermediate programmers who want to **master logic building, loops, and conditionals** in C.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This single file (`bfe0c362-45b3-4d9b-96b3-88edf625840e.c`) contains a curated list of **pattern printing questions (Q1–Q93)**.  
Each program focuses on a specific concept — such as stars, numbers, alphabets, symmetry, and logic-based outputs.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- ✅ **90+ ready-to-run patterns**
- 🧠 Covers **nested loops, conditionals, and number sequences**
- 🔡 Includes **numeric, alphabetic, and mixed patterns**
- 🧩 Demonstrates **Pascal’s triangle, Fibonacci, pyramids, hollow shapes, and diamonds**
- 📚 Useful for **college assignments, practice, and viva preparation**

## 📂 Pattern Categories

| Category | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|
| 🔹 Star Patterns | Triangles, pyramids, diamonds, rhombus |
| 🔹 Number Patterns | Incremental, decremental, mirrored, hollow |
| 🔹 Alphabet Patterns | A–Z pyramids, sequences, and mirrored shapes |
| 🔹 Logical Patterns | Fibonacci series, Pascal’s Triangle, tables |
| 🔹 Complex Shapes | Hollow boxes, hourglass, and mixed character prints |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Compile and Run**

Use any C compiler (like GCC):

```bash
gcc pattern.c -o pattern
./pattern
```

or on Windows (Command Prompt):

```bash
gcc pattern.c -o pattern.exe
pattern.exe
```

### 2. **Choose Your Pattern**

Each program block is labeled as:

```c
// Q.1
// Pattern Description
/*
int main() {
    // pattern logic
}
*/
```

Simply **uncomment** the pattern you want to test and run it.
